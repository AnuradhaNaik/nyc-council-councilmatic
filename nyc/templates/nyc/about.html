            <p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council' title="New York City Council on Wikipedia">New York City Council</a> is the lawmaking body of New York City. The Council comprises <a href='/council-members/'>51 council seats</a> with each representative typically serving a four-year term. The Council is an equal partner with the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City'>Mayor</a> in governing New York City. Its responsibilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Discussing and approving local legislation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Making <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use'>land use decisions</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Approving the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget'>city's budget</a>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Below are the primary types of city council activity.</p>

            {% include 'partials/component_bill_type_table.html' %}

            <p>
                <strong>Introductions</strong> are the most interesting type of legislation because they are proposals for new laws. Once an introduction is passed, it becomes a Local Law - <a href="http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2328524&GUID=E0B4EE30-B5F7-4E90-9C97-CF96D5385E01" target="_blank">see all Local Laws for 2015</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most of the Council's legislative action happens in <a href='/committees/'>committees</a>. Each committee meets in public hearings 2-3 times per month where proposed legislation is debated. Members of other government branches, as well as the public, are able to attend and comment at these hearings.
            </p>

            <p>
                Meetings of the entire Council, referred to as Stated Meetings, occur twice a month at City Hall.
